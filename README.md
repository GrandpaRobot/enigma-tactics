I have an idea for a new type of game
it's kind of like... a combination of battleship and rock paper scissors.
1 v 1 - each player has a grid with which they can move a (or multiple) characters around their 'field'
these characters can have like, class abilities - so maybe a fighter, a paladin, a cleric - thinking FF Tactics job system
You basically have a set number of actions and moves, say - 20 for example.
you pre-program your moves, including which squares to heal, which enemy squares to attack, try to come up with combos (like an aoe paralyze into a fireball combo)
but the catch is that you're just basically attacking your enemy's grid blind, you don't know what they are also setting up on their side of the board
both players program their moveset into the round
and then it plays out those moves turn by turn
victory is assigned to whoever has the most HP among all characters at the end, if all characters get wiped out, they obviously lose
or maybe it goes into round 2
so it's rock paper scissors trying to predict what your opponent is going to do
and battleship trying to attack an unknown grid while setting up your own
can have bigger teams, bigger grids, solo vs solo, duo vs duo, etc...
part autobattler part FF:T part battleship I guess
